# ðŸŽ¥ Movie Recommender System

## Overview

This project is a Movie Recommender System that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. Using the cosine similarity algorithm, it identifies and recommends movies similar to a user's selected movie by analyzing their features.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Examined and visualized key movie attributes such as genres, ratings, and popularity.  
   - Ensured data consistency by handling missing values and duplicates.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Transformed text-based features (like genres and descriptions) into numerical representations.  
   - Standardized features for accurate similarity calculations.  

3. **Cosine Similarity Algorithm**  
   - Calculated pairwise similarity scores between movies based on their features.  
   - Ranked movies to recommend the most relevant ones for a user-selected title.  

4. **User Interface**  
   - Developed an interactive system where users input a movie name to get tailored recommendations.  

## Datasets

The dataset includes the following features:  
- **Movie Title**: Title of the movie.  
- **Genres**: Genres associated with the movie.  
- **Description**: A brief synopsis of the movie.  
- **IMDB Rating**: Rating of the movie.  
- **Popularity**: A score indicating the movie's popularity.
